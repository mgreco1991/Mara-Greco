				<br><br>
				<p>My whole life, ever since I formulated my first memories, I've dreamed of becoming a web developer. At the age of five, I started creating my first HTML pages, and my heart skipped a beat every time I watched my creations come to life on my computer screen.  
				<br><br>
				...Yeah, as if!
				<br><br>
				Having said that, perhaps I wish I had started that way! In actuality, my dream at five years of age was to become a fairy princess. Quite unfortunately, that dream didn't pan out as expected -- I didn't quite make the cut during my magic classes. 
				<br><br>
				But that's all ok, because the guileless pipe dreams of five-year-olds seldom last forever or come to fruition. After realizing that becoming the aforementioned fairy princess wasn't quite as feasible as I had hoped, I set my sights on other pursuits. Yes, throughout the span of my twenty-six years of life, I picked up a plethora of interests and sought to master (or at least become reasonably proficient in) all of them. In highschool, I became a nationally-recognized artist and an accomplished pianist. During college, I became passionate about languages and achieved proficiency in Spanish, Mandarin, and Japanese. After my undergraduate years, I worked as a barista and simultaneously pursued graduate studies in speech-language pathology. 
				<br><br>
				And so the list of endeavors continued. At this point, you might be asking yourself why I am a web developer instead of a speech therapist. Well, that is an excellent question, and the answer is this: it wasn't my niche after all! Indeed, after all of those years of acquiring an eclectic skill set, I found that the best application of my abilities was not in speech therapy, but rather web development. And so, as was my pattern throughout life, I acquired another pursuit, and taught myself to code.  
				<br><br>
				But why web development specifically? Why not any other branch of software development? Well, my artistic and linguistic abilities seemed to naturally mesh well with web development. Now, I see web development as the keystone holding together design and back-end functionality. The artistic intricacies of the design-side and the complex syntax of the back-end development side meet at front-end development, so to speak. 
				<br><br>
				And so, realizing my creative and analytical tendencies, web development is where I ended up, and I couldn't be happier for it.
				<br><br> 
				If you've taken the time to look over the simplified version of my background/life story, I do hope that your takeaway is not simply "wow, that was a mouthful." Rather, I hope that it may serve as the impetus for others (perhaps even you!) to persevere in their passions and never stop learning. Furthermore, where one ends up matters not where one starts, but rather, how one goes about getting there.
